This website needs a lot of work to have features as the [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fekracomputers.islamiclibrary&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1)
- re-desdign the website theme to a modern one
  - better design for displaying book categories and authors
- add user sign in to save user data (last read, favourites, ..)
- add commenting tools in reading (highlight, comment, note)
- Improve the search (in book and book names) to neglect الهمزات والتشكيل

So any help is welcome (Ideas, design or implementation)
